# ReactWeather
This application consists of a React Frontend and a C# Backend. The C# backend is an API that forwards requests to https://www.weatherapi.com/ 
This allows for the API key to be stored on the server instead of being stored client side.

Technologies Utilized: JavaScript, React, reactstrap, C#, ASP.NET Web API

Thanks for taking a look, no live demo at the moment :(
